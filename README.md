## Overview

This repository is home to the *master* and *gh-pages* branches. It uses the [chart-releaser](https://github.com/helm/chart-releaser-action) GitHub Action to package charts in `/charts` on *master* and deploy them as GitHub Releases on *gh-pages*.

For more information on this process see [Chart Releaser Action to Automate GitHub Page Charts](https://helm.sh/docs/howto/chart_releaser_action/).

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts. Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) to get started.

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:

```shell
helm repo add <alias> https://slateci.io/slate-catalog-stable
```

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve the latest versions of the packages. You can then run `helm search repo <alias>` to see the charts.

To install the `<chart-name>` chart:

```shell
helm install my-<chart-name> <alias>/<chart-name>
```

To uninstall the chart:

```shell
helm delete my-<chart-name>
```

## Linting Locally

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for developing, managing, and running OCI containers on your system. Then build the `chart-testing` Docker image:

```shell
docker build --file Dockerfile --tag chart-testing:local .
```

Lint the chart by passing the `lint` command to the container:

```shell
[your@localmachine]$ docker run -it -v ${PWD}:/work chart-testing:local lint
