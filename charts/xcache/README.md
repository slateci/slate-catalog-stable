## Usage

```console
slate app get-conf xcache > xcache.yaml 
slate app install --group <group-name> --cluster <cluster-name> xcache.yaml 
```

## Introduction

XCache is a service that provides caching of data accessed using [xrootd protocol](http://xrootd.org/). It sits in between client and an upstream xrootd servers and can cache/prefetch full files or only blocks already requested.

To run this chart one needs a k8s cluster with a node labeled: **xcache: "<Instance>"**. Instance is the same value as in values.yaml file. This node will have at least 10Gbps connection and at least few TB local disk (preferably mounted at **/scratch**).

To set it up one needs to change values in values.yaml, all other variables have good default values:

```yaml
Instance: <Instance> # change only if you have more than one XCache server. 
SiteConfig:
  Name: MWT2

XCacheConfig:
  CacheDirectories:
    - path: /scratch/1
    - path: /scratch/2
  MetaDirectory: /scratch/meta

Service:
  # External IP that may access the service
  ExternalIP: 192.170.227.151
```
  
XCache nodes should be tainted:

```bash
kubectl taint nodes "xcache nodename" xcache=true:PreferNoSchedule
```

and labeled:

```bash
kubectl label nodes <your-node-name> xcache=<Instance>
```

## Prerequisites

- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `test-release`:

```bash
helm install --name test-release xcache
```

The command deploys xcache on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `test-release` deployment:

```bash
helm delete test-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.
