# The following must be created *before* instantiating a GCSv4 container. 
# Create a new file with the contents:
#   GLOBUS_USER=<username>
#   GLOBUS_PASSWORD=<password>
# And then create the credential with:
#   slate secret create <secret-name> --group <group> --cluster <cluster> \
#    --from-env-file <filename>
GlobusCredentialSecret: globus-creds # maps to <secret-name> as in the above

# The following file must contain usernames and encrypted passwords for any 
# users who may log in to the system. This user will be used to generate a
# MyProxy certificate for the end user who will transfer files.
# 
# The file must follow passwd(5) format. 
#
#                       **IMPORTANT** 
# If you are using MyProxy authentication, you will additionally
# need to include an encrypted password in the second field. 
#          
#   slateci:ENCRYPTEDPASSWORDHERE:1001:1001:SLATE CI:/home/slateci:/bin/bash
#
# Once this file has been created, store it as a SLATE secret with:
#
#   slate secret create <secret-name> --group <group> --cluster <cluster> \
#     --from-file <filename>
#
# OTHERWISE, if you are using CILogon authentication (default) you will need to
# provide an extended passwd(5)-format file with the users' X509 distinguished
# name (DN) in the final field, e.g.:
#   
#   slateci:x:1001:1001:SLATE CI:/home/slateci:/DC=org/DC=cilogon/C=US/O=UNIX University/CN=Charlie Root A1234

# If set, use a nodeSelector to run only on a matching nodes. 
# This is useful when only certain nodes on the cluster mount the appropriate 
# backing filesystem. It may be desirable to turn this off when using a PVC as
# backing storage, since this tends not to tie to a specific node. 
# e.g., "NodeSelector: globus" will match nodes with "globus=true"
