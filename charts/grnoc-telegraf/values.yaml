# SLATE Telegraf Monitoring Configuration
# More information about configuring and running this application can be found here:
# https://slateci.io/blog/telegraf-monitoring.html


# The slate instance value.
Instance: ""

# Optionally write metrics to stdout and local file in container.
writeToStdout: true

# Specifies the default data collection interval.
# Time values can be specified by combining an integer value with a time unit.
# Valid time units include "ns", "us", "ms", "s", "m" and "h".
collectionInterval: "5s"
# Specifies the random offset added to collection times
collectionJitter: "10s"

# Specifies time between output flushes.
# Uses the same syntax as the interval parameter.
flushInterval: "15s"
# Specifies the random offset added to flush times
flushJitter: "10s"


# Configuration for GlobalNOC database output
# Set enabled flag to true to enable GlobalNOC output.
# Set hostname, and username accordingly.
# Set passwordSecretName to the name of a previously created SLATE secret. (see README)
# Note that enabling GRNOC output results in a pre-defined set of
# OIDs being polled, and will override user-specified OIDs.
grnocOutput:
  hostname: "tsds.hostname.net"
  username: "tsds username"
  passwordSecretName: "tsds-password-secret"


# Specify hosts to monitor here. Hosts can be IP addresses or DNS names.
# A hostGroup is a group of hosts that share settings. (e.g. community string, oids, retries, and timeout)
# The "timeout" parameter adjusts how long it takes before an SNMP request is considered failed.
# Set this by specifying an integer and "s" afterwards, for seconds.
# The "retries" parameter specifies how many retries to attempt in the case of a failed SNMP request.
# Simply use an integer here.
#
# A port must also be specififed with a colon after hostname or address. (default is 161, and should probably not be changed)
# Specify OIDs according to the Telegraf SNMP plugin format.
# Documentation can be found at: https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/snmp.
# The counter64Bit parameter is only relevant if GRNOC output has been enabled.
# The specified OIDs should take into account the counter type of the hosts to be monitored.
#
# GRNOC-specific configuration:
# Enabling GRNOC database output results in a pre-configured set of OIDs being polled.
# This means that the OIDs section will be ignored.
# To poll from devices with 64-bit SNMP counters, set the counter64Bit paramter to true.
# To poll from devices with 32-bit SNMP counters, set this parameter to false.
