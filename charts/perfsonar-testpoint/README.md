# perfSONAR Testpoint

Runs a perfSONAR Testpoint on your SLATE cluster. This provides a collection of open source software for performing and sharing end-to-end network measurements. This bundle includes everything from the perfsonar-tools bundle as well as the software required to:

            Automatically run tests on a regular schedule
            Participate in a centrally managed set of tests
            Publish the existence of a measurement node

# Installation

If you have a cluster node dedicated for running perfSONAR, this node needs to have the node label `perfsonar: enabled`.

You can manually label your node using this command:

`kubectl label nodes <node-name> perfsonar=enabled`

Additionally you must run the NTPD service on the perfSONAR node. You can start this by running:

`systemctl start ntpd`

Once that is complete you need to edit the values configuration file to enable node selection.

`slate app get-conf -o conf perfsonar-testpoint`

Edit that file to enable node selection

```
# Default values for perfsonar-testpoint.
# This is a YAML-formatted file.
# Declare variables to be passed into your templates.

Instance: ''

nodeSelection: true
```

Then simply install.

`slate app install perfsonar-testpoint --cluster <cluster name> --group <group name> --conf conf`

# Configuration and usage 

This is the full user guide for the application.
